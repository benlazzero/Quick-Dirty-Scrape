------------------------------------

For scraping website text data fast and dirty

Proabaly not the most accurate scraper/parser one-liner however it's very simple to use and usually returns useable results.

QDScraper boasts zero 3rd-party dependencys by making use of the nodejs https library. This package will most likely DOA.. 
However I will merge all pulls that pass tests, simplify the code, and add accuracy.
